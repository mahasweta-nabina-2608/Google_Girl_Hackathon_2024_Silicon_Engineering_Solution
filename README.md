# Google_Girl_Hackathon_2024_Silicon_Engineering_Solution

My GitHub Code Repository for the Google Girl Hackathon 2024 for the subject Silicon Engineering covers the solution and code for the problem statement given.

Tackled the challenge of optimizing the design of a Network-on-Chip (NOC) for a System on a Chip (SoC) architecture. The goal was to achieve optimal performance in terms of latency, bandwidth, buffer occupancy, and power efficiency. We approached this problem by combining efficient algorithm design with reinforcement learning techniques.
